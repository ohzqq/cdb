comments: <p>Moonmates exist, but getting together is going to be a beast….</p> <p>When Adrian Rothschild skipped his “werewolf puberty”, he assumed he was, somehow, human. But he was wrong, and he’s about to go through his Turn with a country between him and his Pack - scared, alone, and eight years late.</p> <p>Dr. Tate Lewis’ werewolf supremacist father made his Turn miserable, and now Tate works for Camp H.O.W.L. to ease the transition for young werewolves. He isn’t expecting to offer guidance to a grown man - or find his moonmate in Adrian. Tate doesn’t even believe in the legendary bond
